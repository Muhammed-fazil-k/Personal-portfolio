# Issues faced
- How to implement login functionality ?
  - Used http only session cookie to store jwt which will be receiving from backend -strapi(v1)
  - Coundln't deploy with strapi as backend . Migrated to firebase for authentication purpose . Here the logic was different . Creted a context for managing user . Firebase have its own built it user state management . Built authentication based on that

- Deployment
  - It was very headache for me to choose a platform from many . Watched a lot of tutorials and finally thought will host my application in [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
  - While i was developing , i used to hard code url. After deploying some functionalities didn't work as expected. After debugging for some time ðŸ™‚ decided to create a config file for storing base url . It will take proper url value from env variable or by default will consider localhost
